# freetimeupdates-react

This is a react/next.js website set up to be hosted on a serverless environment on AWS.

I went through this tutorial (https://dev.to/adnanrahic/a-crash-course-on-serverless-side-rendering-with-reactjs-nextjs-and-aws-lambda-13ed) and then started customizing the code to get a better understanding of how it all works.

It is currently hosted at the following URL: http://www.freetimeupdates.com
